{1} The Fundamental Unit of Life - Cell
	[A] Intro  
		- Derived from Latin word Cellula(small room)
		- Every living organism is made up of this tiny microscopic unit


	[B] Types of cellular organisms 
		(a) Uni-cellular 
			- All functional and structural properties are provided by only single cell
			- Simple structure; Amoeba, Bacteria, Paramecium

		(b) Multi-cellular 
			- Multi cellular parts(organs) formed and divided to do perticular vital function
			- Complex structure; Plants & Animals

		(c) Prokaryotic cell
			- small(1-10 μm) simple, single-celled organism lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria
			- Genetic material(DNA) is located in a region of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid, not enclosed by a membrane
			- earliest forms of life on Earth essential for decomposition; includes bacteria and archaea domains of life

		(d) Eukaryotic
			- membrane-bound nucleus present that contains the cell's DNA, and other membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts


	[C] Structure of cell
		(a) Cell membrane (plants + animals)
		(b) Cell wall (Only plants)
		(c) Nucleus
		(d) Cytoplasm
		(e) Cell organelles
