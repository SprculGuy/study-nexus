*Compiler setup -->
	After installing Msys2 from 'msys2.org'
	Msys2 -> type command "pacman -Syu"			>update all packages of msys2
	Msys2 -> type "pacman -Su"				>update all base packages
	Installing required packages for C & CPP
		Mingw64 -> type "pacman -Ss gcc"			>checking all available gcc packages list for installation for C and CPP --> mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc [GNU Compiler Collection (C,C++,OpenMP) for MinGW-w64]
		Mingw64 -> type "pacman -S choosen_package_name"	eg. pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc  
			 
		Mingw64 -> type "pacman -Ss gdb"			>checking all available gdb(debugger) packages list for installation for C and CPP --> mingw-w64-x86_64-gdb [GNU Debugger (mingw-w64)]
		Mingw64 -> type "pacman -S choosen_package_name"	eg. pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gdb   
	Adding environment variable path of bin --> C:\msys64\mingw64\bin
		Environment Variables -> System variables > Path > Edit > New -> 'C:\msys64\mingw64\bin'
	Check version at random directories
		gcc --version
		gdb --version
		
*To Compile & Run C++ Program -->
 app.cpp --> pre-processor(HeaderFiles) --> app.i --> compiler --> app.obj --> Linker(LibraryFiles) --> app.exe
Exicute these in terminal of working directory...
->gcc (file name.cpp) (binary file name)                      gcc hello.cpp -o hello		//this'll create obj file 'hello' in working directory
->./(binary file name)										  ./hello						//to exicute that obj file


Exicution of any C++ programme is defaultly from Main function...
we can only pass arguments to main function(), while running code as .exe on command line...
																								1 2 3	So, total no of arg = argc = 3 
int main(int argc, char *argv[]){}							|>c:\user\anynomus\documents\test.exe 6 9
int main(3, "c:\user\anynomus\documents\test.exe", "6", "9")  argv[0]						argv[1] argv[2]
															//argv is pointer array, so it's stoaring address of char type arguments


**PREPROCESSOR--
#include<Standard_lib/header_file>	| We can include any header file(stdio.h) or Standard library file(iostream/fstream)
#include "full_file_path"			| We can include any header file as well as user created sourse file
			--- Header files contains only declearation of identifiers which needs to checks definition in library file
			--- Standard library file contains full definitions of identifiers

#define identifier any_value_char_string			// #define PI 3.14		// #define Msg "Hello" 		// #define SUM(a,b) a+b
#undef identifier									// #define PI			// #define Msg		 		// #define SUM(a,b)
																								if a=2 & b=3 then	a##b = 23
#if _condition
	-----;
#elif _condition
	-----;
#elif _condition
	-----;
#endif

#ifdef PI							|is PI defined
	-----;
#endif

#ifndef PI							|is PI not defined
	-----;
#endif


**NAMESPACE--	(Container for Identifier without same name conflict) it can contain variable/class/functions/object...
	- must be defined globally or nested inside another namespace
	- definition can be continue and extended over more than one file
		ie. we can create same named namespace on multiple files, that simply means 1st namespace's extenstion 
eg.
	namespace Myspace				namespace 		// namespace can be without any name
	{int x; void fun(){}}			{}
	namespace ms = Myspace							// giving alias to access with ease

	Myspace::x=5;
	Myspace::
	using namespace Myspace;						// 'using' keyword allows to import namespace global scope in any namespace also
	x=5;


**OPRATERS---
	& 	- address (referencing or address of) opperator			|UNARY OPERATOR
	* 	- indirectional (de-referencing or value of) opperator	|
	~ 	- bitwise complement									|
	++ 	- increment					 							|
	-- 	- decrement												|
	! 	- logical negation										|
			
	<< 	- shift left											|BINARY OPERATOR
	>> 	- shift right											|
	&	- bitwise and											|
	|	- bitwise or											|
	^	- bitwise xor											|
	&&	- logical and											|
	||	- logical or											|
			
	//	- comment
	/* ... */ - multiline comment

**DEFINING VARIABLES & POINTERS--
		void
	PREMITIVE DATA TYPES
	2	int number = 34;							
	8	int *pnumber = &number;					|	cout<< pnumber		= 76FG34H5
	4	long									|	cout<< *pnumber		= 34
	1	char character = 'A';
	8	char *pcharacter = & character;
	20	char charr[20]							|	fast to exicute
		string str;								|	safe to use, without error	>must use 'string' header file
		string *str = &str;
	4	float
	1	bool x = true;							
	2	bool y = false;
	8	double flot = 45.678;
	8	double *pflot = &flot;					|	pointer var.. can stoares 1st byte address of same variable type of pointer
												|	Ex.for float x has 1000 1001 1010 1011 this adress then float *px = &x stoares 
														base address(1000) in pointer 'px', and this is the reason px must be float.
												|	px + n = px + sizeof(float)*n		&&		px - n = px - sizeof(float)*n
												|	py - px = substraction/sizeof(float) = (1040 - 1000)/4 = 40/4 = 10
												|	px - py = substraction/sizeof(float) = (1000 - 1020)/4 = (-20)/4 = -5
												|					 #as py & px are must float (same)type, having size 4 bytes 

	typedef int LENGTH;		//int also= LENGTH
	LENGTH x,y;				//this line means  >int x,y; 

Wild & Void(generic) Pointer
	int x;				
	void *p;			|	wild pointer - as pointer has garbage adress of unreserved memory
	p = &x;				|	void pointer can stoare adress of any type of variable
	*(int*)p = 11;		|	type-casting void pointer to int, to stoare int value in x. ie, x=11

	(char)x				|	type-casting int to char...

Function Pointer
	void (*p)(int, int);				|	creating"function pointer" for pre defined funtion; void func1(int a, int b) { }
	p = func1;							|	assigning function adress
	p();								|	calling function using function pointer


																0123456789...
		string word;							|string line = "My name is Ankit Patil. I'm 19 years old."
		string *pword = &word;					|line.length();     			>>41
		char sentences[100] = "Ankit Patil";	|line[3] = g					>>My game is...
		int array[] = {12,45,56,673,3,6}		|line.find("Ankit", 3)			>>11		//'3' is starting find index
												|line.substr(11, 5)				>>Ankit		//'5' is size of substring
Reference Variable
	int x = 2;				
	int &y = x;			y is refernce to int variable x, & must be initialised during declearation only.
	y++;				refernce variables can't be updated, we can only access/update the referenced variable value 
	cout<<x;			x = 3


**STOARAGE CLASSES--
	Storg Class	|Default Value	|Stoared	|Scope	|Life

	auto		 garbage		 RAM		 block	 End of block in which variable decleared  //default -inside any block/function.
	register	 garbage		 Register	 block	 End of block in which variable decleared
	static		 0				 RAM		 block	 End of whole Programme
	extern		 0				 RAM		 global	 End of whole Programme	//'extern' used for defining, not declearing variable.
			 //'extern' variable in any block, actually shows that the variable is decleared globally outside of any block\funtion.

ex.	register int a;		register char b; 
	


**PRINTING OUTPUT-- 
		cout << << endl;
		std::cout << << std::endl;
							--without std definition ( using namespace std;)
		printf	printf("%s \n", "string")			\n - new line			\\n - prints \n

				scanf("%f", &variable_name)
				scanf("%lf", &variable_name)

		fgets	fgets(variable_name, 20, stdin);
						        size

		gets	gets(variable_name)


**CONDITIONAL STATEMENT--
 Condition	condition?true:false
			6>5 ? x=6 : x=5;   
							// x gets value 6 as condition is true(ie.6>5)

	IF		if(num1 > num2 && num1 > num3)

			}


**LOOPING STATEMENTS--
	WHILE		while(_condition_)
				{
				}

	DO-WHILE	do
				{
					_block_
				}while(_condition_);

	FOR 		for(int i; i < 10; i++)

**JUMP STATEMENT
	break		# terminates current/working loop and goes out of loop
	continue	# terminates current/working loop and goes for next iteration of loop
	pass		# Used where we don't want any operation to perform
	return		
	goto		 	>x:				#exicution control goes to x: block
					>	cout<<"Hello World";
					>goto x;


**FUNCTIONS--
		inline char hello(int, char*);	
						--'inline' is the request to interchage small functions into simple lines of code, to reduce exicution time.
						--'hello(int, char*)' is "Function Signature",ie. name and parameters with parameter type.
		char hello(int, char*);
							--Declearing post-defined Function, also called as Function Prototype...
		char hello(int arg1, char *arg2[])					
		{															
			return 'A';
		}					--Defining Function Definition(Code)...

	  >>char return_val = hello(a, &b);					
							--calling function with arguments and stoaring it's return value in variable...


**STRUCT data Type--(defaultly all members are public)
		struct Name
		{
			_block_			//Default all defined attributes are public
		}obj1,obj2;			//we can create global objects(variable) just end of defining structure 

	  >>Name obj;
						//creating object(variable) & calling constructor functions... 
		obj1=obj2;

struct date	
{																															 32 bits
private:									Every unsigned int takes 4bytes = 32bit.so Memory will alloted in the multiple of 4 byte
	unsigned int d:5,m:4,y:23;				But, by using "bit-fields" we can declare variable(for struct & union) with its bit size
public:										ie,in 'data' data type every object takes 32(5+4+23) bits ...
	void input()							
	{
		cout<<"Ener Date, Month & Year : ";
		cin>>d>>m>>y;
	}
	void display()							
	{
		cout<<"\n"<<d<<":"<<m<<":"<<y;
	}									
}obj;
obj.d=17;			//Error : as d is private 
obj.input();
obj.display();	


**CLASS data type--(defaultly all members are private) 		
		class Name;				// Declearing post-defined Class
		class Name
		{
		 private:				// Default all defined attributes are private, doesn't matters we specify or not
			Name(){}					//Default Constructor | Constructor never have any return type & it never be static
			Name(int a){}				|
			Name(int a,char a){}		|//Parameterized Constructor(Constructor Overloading)
			Name(Name &a){}				//Copy Constructor | Reason of using reference variable is to avoid creation of object and 
			~Name()							//again calling constructor function in infinite recursion...
		};								//Destructor never have any return type & doesn't takes arguments, it never be static 

	  >>Name obj1,obj2(4),obj3(4,'B'),obj4(obj1);
				//creating instance or object variable & calling constructor functions...
Note:  
  - class can be nested in another class, but members of nested class get accessed only in that class. not from enclosing class... 
		>student::address obj;		- to create object of nested class address outside the student class, address class must be public in student


**ABSTRACT CLASS--		
					- Class containing Pure Virtual function is Abstract Class, means- we can't create object/instance of Abstract class
	void f1()=0;	- By assigning value zero a to function, we create 'DO NOTHING FUNCTION' which can't be accessed/called...
					- Declearing Pure Virtual function in any class causes class to becomes Abstract Class


**VISIBILITY MODES--
		private			-Only Accessible inside class
		Protected		-Accessible from inside & derived/child class, but not to Objects...
		Public			-Accessible to objects, from inside & derived/child class.
		Public Mode:-

Private Mode:-
Public members of base class become private in derived class
Protected members of base class become private in derived class
Private members are inaccessible in derived class

Protected Mode:-
Public members of base class become protected in derived class
Protected members of base class become Protected in derived class
Private members are inaccessible in derived class

Public Mode:-
Public members of base class become public in derived class
Protected members of base class become Protected in derived class
Private members are inaccessible in derived class
				

**INHERITANCE	
				class Child: public Parent							//access specifier(public) shows the scope of attributes/members of Parent class. For public, 
					{													//all the public attributes/members of Parent class are works as public attributes/members in Child class & 
					};													//all the protected attributes/members of Parent class are works as protected attributes/members in Child class

				class Child: private Parent, Parent1				//multiple inheritance with default visibility to private for Parent1 class 
					{												//For private, all the accessible attributes/members of Parent class are works as private attributes/members in Child class
					};									

				class Child: protected Parent,						//For protected, all the accessible attributes/members of Parent class are works as protected attributes/members in Child class
					{							
					};											
				
				Parent *p = new Child;		|creating pointer object p of class Parent and assigning address of obj of Child class
				p -> fun(5);				|calling fuction fun from Parent class as p is obj(poiter obj) of Parent class
				(*p).fun(5);
				
*Note*>	For constructor in inheritance, during exicution. first, constructor of Parent class gets exicuted and then constructor of child class
		For destructor in inheritance, during exicution. first, destructor of child class gets exicuted and then destructor of parent class got call by destructor of child calss


**METHOD OVERLOADING-- "Function is overloaded with multiple jobs (without same signature)(compile time polymorphism)"
					  --  Functions must be in same scope(class) for function overloading
					  
				void f1(int x) {...}			|Rules of Exicution of Function Call-- 
				void f1(int x) {...}			|1. Exact Match with function signature
				char k='5';						|2. Type pramotion [char>int & float>double]
				f1(k)							|3. Type Conversion [premitive>premitive(char,int,float,double)]


**METHOD OVERRIDING/HIDING--  
					  --  Function must be in Parent-Child class with same signature for function overriding
				class Parent
				{
				public:
					void f1() {}	
					void f2() {}
				}
				class Child:Public Parent
				{
				public:
					void f1() {}				// function overriding
					void f2(int a) {}			// function hiding i]f2 call with parameters-runs f2 in Child 
				}												  ii]f2 call without arguments-gives error


**OPERATOR OVERLOADING-- "operator is overloaded with multiple jobs(compile time polymorphism)"
				Complex operator + (Complex c)		|Complex is User defined class data type having a & b attributes...
				{
					Complex temp;
					temp.a = a + c.a;
					temp.b = b + c.b;
					return(temp)
				}
			Complex c1,c2,c3;					
			c1.setdata(3,4);
			c2.setdata(5,6);
			c3 = c1 + c2;		|c3=c1.operator+(c2)|Adding attributes in c1 & c2 objects,assigning them in c3 object's attributes
			c2 = -c1			|c2=c1.operator-()	"For Unary opperators"


**COPY [DEEP/SHALLOW]--
	Shallow Copy 	> Creating an object by copying data of another object only the class attributes
	Deep Copy		> Creating an object by copying data of another object along with the values of memory resources resides outside the 
						object but handled by that object. Mainly, for pointer pointing any dynamic variable...


**TYPE CONVERSION--
	Primitive to Primitive	(char,int,float,double)		> automatically type conversion
	Primitive to Derived Type							> by creating default & parameterised constructor
																Compx_obj = x;					
																Complex(int x) {a=x; b=0;}		//this 'a' & 'b' belongs of class
	Derived to Premitive Type							> by creating casting opperator in class
																int x = Compx_obj;				
																operator int() {return(a)}		//this 'a' belongs of class
	Derived to Premitive Type							> either by constructor or casting opperator													
																Compx1_obj = Compx2_obj;		//For Constructor, must be defined in 1st class
																Complex1(Complex2 x) {a = x.a; b = x.b;}	//a & b must not be private in 2nd class or 
																Complex1(Complex2 x) {a = x.geta(); b = x.getb();}		public function defined with return value a & b
																operator Complex1() {return(a,b)}		//For casting opperator, must be defined in 2nd class
																

**FILE HANDLING--
		MODES--
			ios::in			> only able to read content
			ios::out		> only writing possile. if file exists,erazes old content then write. if file not exist,creates new file then write.
			ios::app		> same as "w". besides, if file already exists, this appends the content after old content of file.
			ios::ate		> Seeks to end of file upon original open
			ios::nocreate	> Open fails if file doesn't exists
			ios::noreplace	> Open fails if file already exists
			ios::binary		> for working in binary mode

			tellg()			> Defined in istream. Returns position of get/reading pointer...
			tellp()			> Defined in ostream. Returns position of put/writing pointer...
			seekg(pos)					> Seeks get/reading poiter to position 'pos'
			seekg(mov, ios_base::beg)	> ::beg / ::cur / ::end  //mov can be negative, & it is relative to 2nd argument
			seekp(pos)					> Seeks put/writing poiter to position 'pos'
			seekp(mov, ios_base::beg)	> ::beg / ::cur / ::end  //mov can be negative, & it is relative to 2nd argument

		file content--					
						fstream fout;
						fout.open("D:\\Anynomus\\Documents\\Programming\\C++\\text.txt", ios::app|ios::binary);

							cout<<ch2;					//get() returns intiger values. For char it returns ASCII value, to avoid that use type-casting
						}      
						fin.close();  


**EXCEPTION HANDLING--

	try
	{throw val;}
	catch(type1 arg){}
	catch(type2 arg){}
		example - 
			try
			{
				cout<<"Exicuted";
				throw 22;					//throw is like return. ie, all lines after throw in try don't get exicuted
				cout<<"NotExicuted";
			}
			catch(double x) {cout<<x;}
			catch(int x) {cout<<x;}
			catch(...) {cout<<"Runs for any type of throw(char/string/int/float/double/derived type )";}


**DYNAMIC VARIABLES--
[C+CPP]
	MALLOC
		float *p;
		p = (float*)malloc(4);		// "malloc" Creates Dynamic Variable of size 4 bytes and returns "void type pointer" of 1st byte
		*p = 3.4;					// so, " float* " used to type cast to "float type pointer" return type
		printf(" %lf \n", *p);

	CALLOC
		int *q;
		q = (int*)calloc(5,2);		// "calloc" Creates Dynamic Variable 'Array' of 5 items each of 2 bytes and returns "void type pointer" 
								// of 1st byte of 1st item.

	REALLOC
		double r;
		r = (double*)realloc(p,8);		// "realloc" re-sizes the block created by "malloc/calloc"
		float r;
		r = (float*)realloc(q,4);

	FREE
		free(p);				
		free(q);				
		free(r);			// releases memory used for dynamic variable created by "malloc/calloc/realloc"

[CPP]
	NEW
	int *p = new int;				// Creates Dynamic Variable of type int(without name) and returns address of 1st byte in the pointer 'p'
	int *p = new int[5];				// Creates Dynamic Array of type int(without name) and returns address of 1st byte in the pointer 'p'
	float *p = new float;
	Structure *p = new Structure;			// Creates Dynamic Object of type Structure(without name) and returns address of 1st byte in the pointer 'p'
	Class *p = new Class;

	DELETE
	delete p;				// releases memory used for dynamic variable on address pointed by pointer 'p', else it'll get realease after programme's end-of-exicution.
	delete []p;				// if we don't use to realease delete it causes Memory Leak.


**TEMPLETS--
	Function Template/Generic Function
		template <class type1, class type2,...> type3 funct_name(type1 a, type2 b,...) { }

	Class Template/Generic class
		template <class type1, class type2,...> class ClassName { };			// we can give attributes type as type1 x; type2 y;....
		    ClassName <int, float, char,...>obj;


**STL (Standard Template Library)--		
	-set of template classes
	-Classes divided into 3 well-structured components
		1] Containers	- Used to manage collection of object of certain kind. Holds elements of any data type...		array, link-list, tree, vectors(dynamic arrays),etc.
		2] Algorithms	- Functions that performs complex algorithms on data of comtainers, ie. Acts on containers... 	initialisation, searching, sorting, transforming,etc.
		3] Iterators	- Used to point/access the content of container one-by-one
	
	>Common Containers--
		array
		vector 			replicates arrays					array <{ObjType}, {ArraySize}>obj = {12,23,34,45,56,...};
		queue 			replicates queues
		stack 			replicates stack
		priority_queue 	replicates heaps 
		list 			replicates linked list
		set 			replicates trees
		map				associative arrays					map <{KeyType}, {ValueType}>obj; 
										- Associative arrays means non-sequencial-numeric[0,1,2,...] indexes. ie, key-value pairs with unique & immutable keys.			
										- these arrays are defaultly sorted by index values.
		eg. 
			#include<iostream>
			#include<array>
			#include<vector>
			#include<map>
			void main()
			{
				array <int,10>obj={12,23,32,4};					// array of int type having size 10

				vector <int>obj;						// vector doesn't need size(zero lenght), it dynamically increases size itself, ie.1,2,4,8,16...
				vector <int>obj{12,23,34,45,56,67};		// creating vector with values assigned, as for 6 values size of array is 8
				vector <int>obj(4);						// vector doesn't need size, but we can give size. Here we given 4
				vector <string>obj(10,"NA");				// creating string vector of size 10 with all 10 spaces	initialises with string "NA"

				map <int, string>obj{	{11, "Raj"},
										{7, "Nikita"},
										{77, "Bharti"}	 };
				obj[17] = "Ankit";
			}
