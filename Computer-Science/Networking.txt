Steps for any host request to the server
    1. DNS lookup
        - checks for server address using domain name. i.e. https://github.com/sprculguy/programming.git  >>  https://123.123.123.123:443/sprculguy/programming.git
    2. TCS/IP socket connection establishment between host and server
        - Breaks data into packets, which are then routed to the destination and reassembled. 
        - TCP is responsible for reliable data delivery, while IP handles addressing and routing the packets 
    3. HTTP request
        http request example -
            GET /sprculguy/programming.git HTTP/1.1     | -> start line: HTTP method + request target + HTTP version
            Host: www.google.com                        |
            User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0                     | -> HTTP request headers
            Accept-Language: en-US                      |
            <BODY>                                      | -> Request body(only when sending data to the server.e.g. HTTP method POST)
    4. HTTP response
        http response example -
            HTTP/1.1 200 OK                             | -> start line: HTTP version + status code + status message
            Date: Fri, 18 Jan 2021                      |
            Content-Type: text/html                     | -> HTTP response headers
            Transfer-Encoding: chunked                  |
            <BODY>                                      | -> Response body



Classic ports to know  
    21 = FTP(File Transfer Protocol) - upload files into a file share
    22 = SFTP(Secure File Transfer Protocol)
    80 = HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) - access unsecured websites
    433 = HTTPS(Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) - access secured websites
    22 = SSH(Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
    3389 = RDP(Remote Desktop Protocol) - log into a windows instance

	5432 = PostgreSQL  
    3306 = MySQL  
    1521 = Oracle RDS  
    1433 = MSSQL Server  
    3306 = MariaDB (same as MySQL)
    5432 = Aurora PostgreSQL compatible

   

Hosts 
    - Any devices that sends & receives trffic; eg. client, server.
    - Any Host needs 4 things for Internet connectivity
        1. IP address           - Identity (192.168.0.1)
        2. Subnet Mask          - Defines size/scope of local network
        3. Default Gateway      - Routers IP address
        4. DNS server IP address- Gives domain names to IP address
        - DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server - provides configuration(IP,SM,DG,DNS) dynamically for host to connect to the Internet



Protocols
    - Set of rules & messages that forms internet standard
        eg. ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) 
				- Resolves IP to Mac address mapping
            HTTP(Web server)
            HTTPS(HTTP with SSL(SecureSocketLayer)/TSL(TransportLayerSecurity))
            DNS(Domain Name System) server
			TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
				- Connection-oriented protocol that guarantees ordered and error-checked(slower than UDP) delivery of data
				- Ideal for applications where data integrity is crucial, such as; file transfers, web browsing, and email
			UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
				- Connectionless protocol that prioritizes faster data delivery by sending packets directly to an addressed destination, without guaranteeing delivery or order
				- Ideal for applications where some data loss is tolerable, such as; streaming video, online gaming, and VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)

DNS(Domain Name Server)
    - special kind of Server with stored domain name and IP address mapping
	Terminologies
		- Domain Registrar : AWS Route53, GoDaddy, etc.
		- DNS Record : A, AAAA, CNAME(Canonical Name), NS(NameServer), CAA, DS, MX, NAPTR, PTR, SOA, TXT, SPF, SRV, etc.
		- Zone File : contains DNS records,to match these hostnames to IPs
		- Name Server: resolves DNS queries(Authoritative{the customer can update the DNS records} or Non-Authoritative)
		- Top Level Domain (TLD): .com, .us, .in, .gov, .org, etc.
		- Second Level Domain (SLD): amazon.com, google.com, etc.

CORS(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) - Security mechanism that allows web applications to access resources from other domains
    - CORS defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain
    - CORS allows the client browser to check with the third-party servers if the request is authorized before any data transfers
	- origin = protocol(https) + domain(www.example.com) + port(443)
	- CORS is Web Browser based mechanism used to allow request to other origins(allowing requests with CORS(Access-Control-Allow-Origin) headers) from the main origin

CIDR(Classless Inter-Domain Routing) : a method for allocating IP addresses
    - consists of two components 
        • Base IP
            - Represents an IP contained in the range (XX.XX.XX.XX)
            - Example: 10.0.0.0, 192.168.0.0, etc.
        • Subnet Mask
            - Defines how many bits can change in the IP
            - Example;
                • /0 : 0.0.0.0         		192.168.0.0/0 	=>     0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255	all IPs
                • /1 : 0.0.0.0         		192.168.0.0/1 	=>   128.0.0.0 - 254.255.255.255	2,147,483,648 IPs
                • /8 : 255.0.0.0 			192.168.0.0/8 	=> 	 192.0.0.0 - 192.255.255.255	16,777,216 IPs
                • /16 : 255.255.0.0    		192.168.0.0/16 	=> 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255	65,536 IPs
                • /24 : 255.255.255.0 		192.168.0.0/24 	=> 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.255		256 IPs
                • /31 : 255.255.255.0 		192.168.0.0/31 	=> 192.168.0.0 & 192.168.0.1		2 IPs
                • /32 : 255.255.255.255		192.168.0.0/32 	=> 		  192.168.0.0				1 IP



Internet Assigned Numbers Authority(IANA) 	
	- defined certain blocks of IPv4 addresses for the use of private(LAN) and public(Internet) addresses
		• Private IP can only allow certain values:
		• 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8) 			; in big networks
		• 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12) 		; AWS default VPC in that range
		• 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16) 	; home networks
	- All the rest of the IP addresses on the Internet are Public
