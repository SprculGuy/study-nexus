Choosing right database
	• Read-heavy, write-heavy, or balanced workload? 
	• Throughput needs? Will it change, does it need to scale or fluctuate during the day?
	• How much data to store and for how long? Will it grow? 
	• Average object size? How are they accessed?
	• Data durability? Source of truth for the data?
	• Latency requirements? Concurrent users?
	• Data model? How will you query the data? Joins? Structured? Semi-Structured?
	• Strong schema(RDB)? More flexibility(NoSQL)? require Reporting? Search?
	• License costs? Switch to Cloud Native DB such as Aurora?

DataBase Types
	• RDBMS(= SQL / OLTP): RDS, Aurora – great for joins
	• NoSQL database – no joins, no SQL : DynamoDB(~JSON), ElastiCache(key/value pairs), Neptune(graphs), DocumentDB(for MongoDB), Keyspaces(for Apache Cassandra)
	• Object Store: S3(for big objects) / Glacier(for backups / archives)
	• Data Warehouse(= SQL Analytics / BI): Redshift(OLAP), Athena, EMR
	• Search: OpenSearch(JSON) – free text, unstructured searches
	• Graphs: Amazon Neptune – displays relationships between data
	• Ledger: Amazon Quantum Ledger Database
	• Time series: Amazon Timestream
