** DOCKER -  
		Software development platform to deploy apps which are packaged in containers that can be run on any OS regardless of where they’re run
		Docker virtualizes only the host OS kernel, so containers must be compatible with the host OS. Whereas, VMs emulate entire hardware using hyperviser software, allowing independent OS
		Docker simplifies the deployment process, promotes consistency across different environments, and enhances scalability by isolating applications into containers


** Key components of Docker include:
		1. Docker Engine:
			- Core technology that enables the creation and management of containers
			- Includes a server daemon and a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with Docker

		2. Docker Image: 
			- Read-only(immutable) templates(configuration files) that serve as the blueprints/instructions for creating the container
			- Includes all the necessary components to run a application, such as code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

		3. Container Engine:
			- Manages the entire lifecycle of the container, from creation to operation.
                    contains -> 1.namespaces(limits what you can see - specifies what containers can access on a linux system)
                                2.control groups(limits what you can use - specifies how much of the resources containers can consume)
			- Popular Container Engines;
					Kubernetes - an open-source system for management, deployment, and scaling of containerized apps (Docker)
					Docker Swarm

		4. Container runtime: 
			- The software that actually executes and manages containers
			- component of the container engine that used to configure control groups and namespaces proprties.

		5. Container:
			- An one time instances of a Docker image that runs in isolation from the host system, providing a consistent and reproducible environment for applications.
			- standalone, lightweight VMs, and executable software packages 

		6. Dockerfile: 	
			- Text file that contains environment instructions for building a Docker image. 
			- Specifies the base image, application code, dependencies, and other configuration settings.

		7. Docker Hub: 	
			- Centralized public repository to store, share, and discover Docker images. Private registries for organization's images can be created.

		8. Docker Compose: 
			- Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to specify a multi-container application setup in a YAML file, making it easier to manage complex deployments.


** Simplified (Cake Baking Analogy):
		Docker Engine 					Entire bakery, including the ovens, mixing stations, and the staff that manages the baking process.
		Docker Image 					Recipe for the cake.
		Dockerfile 						List of ingredients and instructions in the recipe.
		Container Engine 				Entire baking operation across multiple bakeries, ensuring efficient production and delivery of cakes to different locations.
		Container 						Serving plate or box that holds the baked cake.
		Container Runtime 				Oven itself that bakes the cake.
		Application 					Actual baked cake.

		Docker Hub 						Cookbook sharing website where you find recipes.
		Docker Compose 					Guide for baking a multi-layered cake.


Important directories and files -
		/var/lib/docker                 almost all the docker data(containers, volumes, metadata) get stored in this directory
		/var/lib/docker/overlay         stores container data while container is running
		/var/run/docker.sock            pipe between doker engine and docker client (termed as unix socker file)
		/etc/docker/daemon.json         docker engine configuration(might not exist defaultly)


Docker limitations -
		nativly only on Linux and some latest versions of windows
		container images are bound to their parent operating system

		containers are created form container images 
		container images are a compressed and pre-packaged file system that contains application along with its environment and configuaration with an instruction(entry point) on how to start the application
